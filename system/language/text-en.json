The entire system includes a database of defect recognition and a library of algorithmic models. The defect recognition models are mainly convolutional neural networks, which can be imported and built using the Drag & Drop module. The current version is 1.0 beta, mainly applicable to the surface defect classification, and will continue to be developed for the detection and localization.",
